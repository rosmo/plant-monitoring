# ESP-IDF ESP32-C3 plant moisture monitoring

This code monitors 3 ADC sensors on a ESP32-C3 and sends their values to InfluxDB.

## What it does

1. Connect to WiFi (configurations under [Kconfig](main/Kconfig.projbuild))
2. Synchronize time with NTP (local NTP server highly recommended!)
3. Get a URL that contains the station config (MAC to station name mapping) (protip: you can host this on Home Assistant)
4. Read the ADC sensors
5. Write the values into InfluxDB 1.8+ (using InfluxDB v2 API) (protip: you can also install this into Home Assistant)

## Configuring

If you have Home Assistant, you can create a `/www` directory under the configuration directory.
Files there will be available under your Home Assistant URL with `/local/` path. Eg. I created
a file called `plants.txt` under the `www/` directory with the following contents:

```Â¨
64:e8:33:00:7a:54 living_room
d4:f9:8d:03:75:00 bed_room
```

Then the `ESP_CONFIG_URL` I have set `http://homeassistant.localdomain/local/plants.txt`.

To get the MAC addresses, flash the firmware according to instructions below and look for this
in the serial output:

```
I (6452) plantmonitoring: WiFi MAC address: d4:f9:8d:03:75:00
```

## Building

Install ESP-IDF 5.0+.

```sh
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py build
```

To flash, press the B button on the ESP32C3 and connect USB-C cable, then run (replace `COM5` with the COM port you have connected the ESP32 to):

```sh
idf.py -p COM5 flash
```

Then reconnect the USB cable and monitor the serial:

```sh
idf.py -p COM5 monitor
```
